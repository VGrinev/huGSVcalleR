#' Index a VCF file with known variants
#' @description This is a wrapper function that uses the low-level function
#'     IndexFeatureFile() from package GATK to built a .tbi index for VCF file
#'     with known variants.
#' @param vcfDir character string giving the name (or path to and name) of
#'     directory with VCF file(s). NULL by default, which means that the
#'     current working directory will be used instead of the specified VCF
#'     directory.
#' @param vcfFile character string giving the name of input VCF file.
#' @param output_name character string giving the name of index. NULL by
#'     default, which means that the name of input VCF file will be uased.
#'     Important note: to be used correctly by the GATK, the VCF file and its
#'     index must have the same name.
#' @param gatk_path character string giving the path to internal or external
#'     (system) GATK executive script. This path can be obtained by running
#'     Find.Gatk() or settled manually. Default value is "gatk", i.e. function
#'     will uses GATK systemly from $PATH.
#' @param workDir character string giving the path to and name of work
#'     directory. NULL by default that means the current working directory.
#' @return .tbi file in working directory.
