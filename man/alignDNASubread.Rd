\title{Local alignment of short DNA-Seq reads by seed-and-vote algorithm}
\usage{
alignDNASubread(
  genome,
  fastqDir,
  fastq1,
  fastq2 = NULL,
  bamDir,
  bamFile,
  orientation = "fr",
  threads = 1,
  SV = FALSE,
  workDir = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genome}{character vector giving the path to and basename of index file.}

\item{fastqDir}{character vector giving the path to and name of directory
with FASTQ file(-s).}

\item{fastq1}{character vector including the name of FASTQ file containing
DNA-Seq reads to be aligned. For paired-end reads, this gives the name
of FASTQ file for first reads in each DNA-Seq library.}

\item{fastq2}{character vector including the name of FASTQ file containing
second DNA-Seq reads to be aligned. NULL by default.}

\item{bamDir}{character vector giving the path to and name of output
directory for BAM file.}

\item{bamFile}{character vector giving the name of output BAM file.}

\item{orientation}{character string giving the orientation of the two reads
from the same pair. Default value is "fr" (forward for the first read
and reverse for second one).}

\item{threads}{numeric value giving the number of threads used for mapping.
Default value is 1.}

\item{SV}{logical value indicating if structural variants will be detected
during read mapping. Default value is FALSE.}

\item{workDir}{character string giving the path to and name of work
directory. NULL by default that means the current working directory.}
}
\value{
BAM and VCF (if SV argument is TRUE) file(-s) are written to the
bamDir directory.
}
\description{
This is a wrapper function that uses the low-level function
align() from package Rsubread to align the short DNA-Seq reads by
seed-and-vote algorithm.
